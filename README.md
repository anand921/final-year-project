Ensuring long-distance data transmission and high dependability is essential in contemporary 
communication systems, particularly in dynamic contexts. The goal of this research is to improve 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication by integrating Differential Chaos Shift Keying 
(DCSK) with Free Space Optical (FSO) communication. The performance of the system may be harmed 
by issues including atmospheric turbulence, targeting errors, and random position fluctuations brought 
on by UAVs' hovering capability. In order to overcome these problems, a serial relay-assisted 
communication approach is used, in which intermediate UAVs serve as relay nodes to increase the FSO 
link's robustness and coverage. By calculating the Bit Error Rate (BER) expressions, the system's 
performance is assessed analytically while taking into account a number of variables, including relay 
locations, turbulence impacts, and pointing losses. To verify accuracy, simulation results are compared 
to the analytical models. The results show that FSO with relay assistance and DCSK modulation greatly 
improves the transmission range and reliability of swarm-based UAV communication networks, making 
it a viable option for upcoming aerial communication applications.
